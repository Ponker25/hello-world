# hello-world
Just another repository
My name is William Swensen and I am new to coding. I am currently registered to begin a coding bootcamp as a way to build my skills in preparation for a career move. I am happily married with 3 dogs and no children. We are currently entertaining the option of moving out of the country within the next 3-5 years.
